Ð¢here was no experience in this area, but there is a desire to try yourself in it. My strong point is execution, as well as desire to develop. A great desire to prove to myself, first of all, that I really can. I can achieve what I wish.Getting new knowledge that develops a skill in a business that interests you is doubly pleasant and very motivating.
The course I am taking at the moment is my first experience in programming.
